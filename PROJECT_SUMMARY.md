# AMM System: Project Summary

## Overview

The Agno Memory Module (AMM) System is a framework for building AI agents with fixed knowledge and adaptive memory capabilities. It leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) models to create intelligent assistants that can access knowledge sources and learn from interactions.

## Key Components

### Core Components

1. **AMM Engine** (`amm_project/engine/amm_engine.py`)
   - The central component that processes queries using knowledge and memory
   - Handles initialization of knowledge sources, embedding, and retrieval
   - Manages adaptive memory through SQLite

2. **AMM Models** (`amm_project/models/amm_models.py`)
   - Data models for system configuration and design
   - Includes knowledge source types, memory settings, and model configurations

3. **Memory Models** (`amm_project/models/memory_models.py`)
   - Models for adaptive memory (interaction records)
   - SQLAlchemy ORM integration for database operations

4. **PDF Processor** (`amm_project/utils/pdf_processor.py`) 
   - Processes PDF files for use as knowledge sources
   - Handles text extraction, OCR, and intelligent chunking
   - Supports both text-based and scanned documents

   - Handles command-line arguments and server configuration

3. **MCP Key Manager** (`mcp_key_manager/`)
   - Tools for managing API keys for secure access to MCP servers
   - Includes CLI and web UI components

### Utilities

1. **File Handling** (`amm_gui/utils/file_handling.py`)
   - Utilities for handling files, including PDF preview
   - Supports file validation and copying

2. **AMM Integration** (`amm_gui/utils/amm_integration.py`)
   - Utilities for integrating AMM with other components
   - Handles design serialization and validation

3. **PDF Processor** (`amm_project/utils/pdf_processor.py`)
   - Handles PDF file processing for knowledge extraction
   - Supports OCR for scanned documents

## Recent Additions and Improvements

1. **PDF Knowledge Sources**
   - Added support for PDF documents as knowledge sources

   - Fixed import errors in built MCP servers
   - Added GUI integration for testing MCP servers

3. **CLI Tools**
   - Added comprehensive CLI for managing MCP servers
   - Implemented interactive mode with menu-driven operation
   - Added commands for finding, launching, stopping, and testing servers

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Created unit tests for the MCP CLI, import fixer, and server manager
   - Added PDF processor and file handling tests
   - Improved test runner for MCP-related tests

5. **Documentation**
   - Added PDF knowledge guide

3. **Advanced PDF Features**
   - Add support for table extraction from PDFs
   - Implement form field extraction
   - Support for PDF annotations as metadata

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize PDF processing for large documents
