# AMM Project Handoff Document - May 20, 2025

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Agno Memory Module (AMM) project state for seamless resumption of work. It includes environment setup instructions, build processes, testing procedures, current status, lessons learned, and next steps.

## Environment Setup

### Python Environment

The project uses Conda for environment management:

```bash
# Environment name: agno-amm
conda create -n agno-amm python=3.12
conda activate agno-amm
```

#### Python Dependencies

Required packages are specified in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
# Install main dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# PDF processing dependencies (recently added)
pip install PyPDF2>=3.0.0 pdfplumber>=0.10.1

# Optional OCR dependencies
pip install pytesseract>=0.3.10 pdf2image>=1.16.3
```

#### OS-Specific OCR Setup

For OCR functionality with scanned PDFs:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y tesseract-ocr poppler-utils
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install tesseract
brew install poppler
```

**Windows:**
1. Download Tesseract installer from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Download poppler from http://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/
3. Add both to PATH environment variable

### Docker Environment

The project does not currently utilize Docker, but a containerization process is planned for future iterations:

**Planned Docker configuration:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (planned, not yet implemented)
version: '3'
services:
  amm-api:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.api
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - GOOGLE_API_KEY=${GOOGLE_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
  
  amm-gui:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.gui
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
    depends_on:
      - amm-api
```

## Build Process

### Standard Build

The AMM system uses a build process for creating standalone MCP servers:

```bash
# Before starting, ensure you're in project root directory
cd /home/o2satz/MyGit/AFTER_CRASH/May19_AMM

# Build an MCP server from a design file
python build_amm.py /path/to/design.json --build-type mcp_server

# Or use the clean build script (recommended)
./clean_build_v3.sh /path/to/design.json /path/to/output
```

### Build Options

The clean build script supports various options:
- `--api-key-required`: Enable API key authentication
- `--api-key KEY`: Set specific API key for the server
- `--host HOST`: Set the host interface (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--port PORT`: Set the server port (default: 8000)

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

Common build issues and solutions:

1. **Import Errors in Built MCP Server**
   - Use the fix_imports.py script: `python fix_imports.py /path/to/build_dir`
   - Verify that all module files are copied to the build directory

2. **Missing AMM Instances Directory**
   - Create the directory manually: `mkdir -p amm_instances`
   - Ensure the build has the correct permissions

3. **PDF Dependencies Missing**
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install PyPDF2 pdfplumber`
   - For OCR: `pip install pytesseract pdf2image`

## Starting the Application

### Running the GUI

```bash
# Start the Streamlit GUI
cd /home/o2satz/MyGit/AFTER_CRASH/May19_AMM
streamlit run amm_gui/app.py
```

### Running MCP Servers

**Option 1: Using the MCP CLI**
```bash
# Interactive mode
python mcp_cli.py

# Command-line mode
python mcp_cli.py list  # List available servers
python mcp_cli.py launch /path/to/server --port 8000
```

**Option 2: Using the start_mcp.sh script**
```bash
# Start the most recent server
./start_mcp.sh [PORT]
```

**Option 3: Direct execution**
```bash
# Navigate to server directory and run
cd /path/to/server
python start_server.py --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests/unit

# Run specific test modules
python -m unittest tests/unit/test_pdf_processor.py
python -m unittest tests/unit/test_file_handling.py

# Run MCP tests
./run_mcp_tests.py

# Test the PDF integration
./test_pdf_integration.py
```

### Current Test Coverage

- Core functionality: ~85% coverage
- MCP components: ~80% coverage
- PDF integration: ~75% coverage
- GUI components: ~60% coverage

### Known Test Issues

1. **Property Mocking in Tests**
   - Issue: AttributeError: 'property' object has no attribute 'return_value'
   - Workaround: Use `new_callable=PropertyMock` when patching properties

2. **PDF Processing Tests Without Dependencies**
   - Issue: Tests fail if PDF libraries aren't installed
   - Workaround: Tests are skipped automatically if dependencies are missing

3. **MCP Server Manager Test Failures**
   - Issue: Streamlit session state errors in tests
   - Workaround: Mock Streamlit functions or run tests with `--no-ui` flag

## Lessons Learned

### Key Challenges

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Challenge: Balancing standalone operation with integrated functionality
   - Solution: Created wrapper scripts and import fixers to support both modes
   - Impact: Much improved deployment flexibility, but added build complexity

2. **PDF Processing Complexity**
   - Challenge: Handling diverse PDF formats, especially scanned documents
   - Solution: Implemented multi-stage processing with fallbacks for different PDF types
   - Impact: More robust document processing, but increased dependency requirements

3. **Testing Asynchronous Components**
   - Challenge: Testing MCP servers and client interactions
   - Solution: Developed mock servers and clients with controlled response patterns
   - Impact: Better test coverage, but increased test suite complexity

### Resolved Issues

1. **Import Errors in MCP Servers**
   - Issue: Built servers couldn't find required modules
   - Resolution: Created fix_imports.py script to modify import paths
   - Takeaway: Need better module isolation in future designs

2. **Connection Refused Errors**
   - Issue: MCP servers not accessible from remote clients
   - Resolution: Changed default host from "127.0.0.1" to "0.0.0.0"
   - Takeaway: Always consider network interface binding for services

3. **PDF Extraction Failures**
   - Issue: Some PDFs returning empty content
   - Resolution: Implemented cascading extraction methods with fallbacks
   - Takeaway: PDF formats are highly variable; always have multiple strategies

### Recommendations

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Explicitly manage optional dependencies with fallbacks
   - Document OS-specific requirements clearly
   - Consider containerization to standardize environments

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Focus on unit testing for core components
   - Use integration tests for connected components
   - Implement proper mocking techniques for external services

3. **Documentation Approach**
   - Keep code and documentation in sync
   - Include examples for key features
   - Document workarounds and common issues
